The Ginza district is considered the high fashion center of Tokyo, hosting
numerous prestigious luxury stores, galleries, restaurants, night clubs. E.g.
Sukiyabashi Jiro, a Michelin three-star sushi restaurant featured in the
"Jiro Dreams of Sushi" documentary, is found in Ginza.

I'm not very much into the high fashion, jewelry or super expensive restaurants,
quite opposite in fact.
What I really liked here was the "pedestrian heaven" (Hokoten in Japanese)
that rules on the main street that cuts through Ginza, Chuo Dori. This is a big
street that goes through Tokyo and is normally busy with cars. On the weekends its
part in Ginza is simply closed for traffic for most of the day, and turns into
a vibrant mix of people rushing from one shop to another.
