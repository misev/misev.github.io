excerpt: At the end of October we spent a few days in Southeast Switzerland with
  <a href="https://500px.com/sanderpriivits" target="_blank">Sander</a>, mostly around
  the Flims and St. Moritz areas. We were extremely lucky with the weather -- perfectly
  clear skies with zero wind throughout the whole trip. The Swiss landscapes really
  popped out in this weather, enjoy the photos :-)
